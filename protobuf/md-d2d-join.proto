// ## Device Join Protocol
//
// This protocol specifies how to add a new device to an existing device group.
//
// ### Terminology
//
// - `ED`: Existing device
// - `ND`: New device to be added
// - `PSK`: Key derived from the passphrase
//
// ### Key Derivation
//
//     PSK = Argon2id(
//       out-length=32,
//       parameters=<see DeviceGroupJoinRequestOrOffer.Argon2idParameters>,
//       password=<passphrase>,
//     )
//
// ### Blobs
//
// For binary data, the usual Blob scheme is being used by ED. However, instead
// of transferring Blob data via the Blob server, the data is transmitted in
// form of a `common.BlobData` message ahead of a message referencing that Blob
// by the associated Blob ID.
//
// ND is supposed to cache received `common.BlobData` until it can associate the
// data to a Blob referencing its ID. Once the rendezvous connection has been
// closed, any remaining cached `common.BlobData` can be discarded.
//
// ### Protocol Kickoff Flow
//
// ND or ED may choose to start the protocol. If ND starts the protocol it is
// _requesting to join the device group_. If ED starts the protocol it is
// _offering to join the device group_.
//
// Whichever role is chosen, the one that starts the protocol must generate and
// display or request an ephemeral passphrase from the user to encrypt the data
// with.
//
// From that passphrase, derive the Passphrase Key (PSK) using a 16 byte random
// salt and Argon2id parameters that target a ~2s key derivation performance
// impact on the weaker device. For the time being, the following Argon2id
// parameters are to be used:
//
// - Version: 1.3
// - Memory: 128 MiB
// - Iterations: 3
// - Parallelism: 1
//
// If ED started the protocol:
//
// - `variant` must be set to _offer to join the device group_.
// - ED takes the role of RID
// - ND takes the role of RRD
//
// If ND started the protocol:
//
// - `variant` must be set to _request to join the device group_.
// - ND takes the role of RID
// - ED takes the role of RRD
//
// #### Connection Setup
//
// RID creates a `rendezvous.RendezvousInit` by following the Connection
// Rendezvous Protocol. It encrypts the created `rendezvous.RendezvousInit` with
// PSK, wraps it in a `url.DeviceGroupJoinRequestOrOffer` and offers it in form
// of a URL or a QR code.
//
// RRD scans the QR code or decodes the URL and then parses the
// `url.DeviceGroupJoinRequestOrOffer`. It will then use PSK to decrypt the
// contained `rendezvous.RendezvousInit`. Once decrypted, the enclosed
// `rendezvous.RendezvousInit` must be handled according to the Connection
// Rendezvous Protocol.
//
// Once the Connection Rendezvous Protocol has established at least one
// connection path, ED waits another 3s or until all connection paths have been
// established. Nomination is then done by ED following the Connection
// Rendezvous Protocol.
//
// Note that all messages on the nominated connection path must be end-to-end
// encrypted as defined by the Connection Rendezvous Protocol. All transmitted
// messages are to be wrapped in:
//
// - `NdToEd` when sending from ND to ED, and
// - `EdToNd` when sending from ED to ND.
//
// #### Device Join Flow
//
// As soon as one of the connection paths has been nominated by ED, both devices
// must calculate the Rendezvous Path Hash (RPH) as defined by the Rendezvous
// Protocol and display it to the user.
//
// ED must ask the user for confirmation that RPH is visually equal on both
// devices. If the user does not confirm, the process must be aborted.
//
// After confirmation, ED must stop displaying RPH and send a `Begin` message to
// start the device join process.
//
//     ED ------- Begin ------> ND   [1]
//
// ND can now stop displaying RPH.
//
//     ED -- common.BlobData -> ND   [0..N]
//     ED --- EssentialData --> ND   [1]
//
// Once ND successfully registered itself on the Mediator server, it sends a
// `Registered` message.
//
//     ED <---- Registered ---- ND   [1]
//
// ND may now either close the connection or leave it open to transition to the
// History Exchange Protocol. Any further messages ED receives from ND will
// transition into the History Exchange Protocol.
