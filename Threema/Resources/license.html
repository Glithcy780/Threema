<p>curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function</p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/</p>

<p>Adam Langley agl@imperialviolet.org</p>

<p>Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein djb@cr.yp.to</p>

<p>More information about curve25519 can be found here http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</p>

<p>djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly language called qhasm and uses the floating point registers.</p>

<p>This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It uses many of the tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken from the sample implementation.</p>

of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in

under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p><strong><a name="additional">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</a></strong>.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>
